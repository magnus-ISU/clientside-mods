# Minecraft mods I use

This pack contains the (clientside) mods I prefer to play with.

## Github for dummies

1. Look for a green button that says 'Code'
2. Download the ZIP
3. Open it and get the files from within

This repository is intended to be used within `.minecraft` directly, so it contains separate `mods/`, `resourcepacks`, and `config` directories. The reason is that some mods have terrible defaults, and it offers a good way to add more stuff to it later if desired.
